WHAT<br>
The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), funded by the National Science Foundation, is planned as a networked infrastructure of science-driven sensor systems to measure the physical, chemical, geological and biological variables in the ocean and seafloor. The OOI will be one fully integrated system collecting data on coastal, regional and global scales. Greater knowledge of the oceanâ€™s interrelated systems is vital for increased understanding of their effects on biodiversity, ocean and coastal ecosystems, ecosystem health and climate change. The OOI will put real-time ocean observing data in the hands of a vast user community of oceanographers, scientists and researchers, educators and the public.<br><br>
WHY<br>
Ocean science is at a juncture where the broad scientific and civil demands for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research require a distinct departure from the traditional approach of individuals or small groups of scientists working to solve problems within a single science domain. Coupled with exponential growth in information technology, these trends are irrevocably changing oceanography.<br><br>
HOW<br>
Funded by NSF, the OOI will have a global, physical observatory footprint, and is designed to provide new, persistent and interactive capabilities for ocean science. A sophisticated cyberinfrastructure will provide the background messaging, governance and service frameworks that will facilitate oceanographic data collection, research and collaboration in a shared environment.
