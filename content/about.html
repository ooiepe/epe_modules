<p>The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) is a project funded by the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation">NSF</a>).&nbsp; It is a networked infrastructure of science-driven sensor systems to measure the physical, chemical, geological and biological variables in the ocean and seafloor as well as the overlying atmosphere, providing a fully integrated system collecting data on coastal, regional and global scales.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of the OOI is to deliver data and data products for a 25-year-plus time period within an expandable architecture that can meet emerging technical advances in ocean science.&nbsp; These data will be freely accessible online through the OOI Cyberinfrastructure.</p><p>The OOI Program is managed and coordinated by the OOI Program Office at the <a href="http://www.oceanleadership.org">Consortium for Ocean Leadership</a>, in Washington, D.C., and is responsible for construction and initial operations of the OOI network.&nbsp; Implementing Organizations are responsible for construction and development of the overall program. <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers, The State University of New </a><a href="http://www.rutgers.edu/">Jersey</a>, with its partners <a href="http://www.umaine.edu/">University of Maine</a> and <a href="http://www.raytheon.com/businesses/riis/mos/index.html">Raytheon Mission Operations and Services</a>, is responsible for the education and public engagement software infrastructure accessed through the Ocean Education Portal.</p><p>For more information about the OOI and the latest updates check out the OOI website: <a href="http://oceanobservatories.org/">http://oceanobservatories.org/</a></p>
