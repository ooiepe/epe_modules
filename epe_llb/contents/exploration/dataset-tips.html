<p><strong>Dataset Ideas</strong>
<p>You can use several different kinds of datasets in your investigation.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Visualizations:</strong> Create your own customized visualizations to focus students' attention on particular datasets, processes or analyses. You can create multiple tools with increasing complexity to scaffold your students' use of the tools. For example, start off with a visualization of a single time-series and then create a second visualization that includes additional stations or variables for students to compare.</li>
  <li><strong>Concept Maps:</strong> Consider creating a concept map if you would like students to explore a complex topic or  allow them to explore a non-linear process.</li>
  <li><strong>Images:</strong> Add images if you would like students to investigate static imagery. This can include maps, graphs, charts, photographs, diagrams, or a slide exported from a presentation. You can select images already included in the resource database or upload your own.</li>
  <li><strong>Videos:</strong> Video footage can also be used as data, especially video from underwater cameras. Of course, you can also use videos to provide background information on the concepts students should investigate.</li>
  <li><strong>Documents:</strong> If you have a scientific paper, a worksheet, or an spreadsheet you would like students to review, you can add them too.</li>
</ul>
