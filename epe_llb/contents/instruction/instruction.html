<h4>Welcome to the Data Investigation Builder</h4>
<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span7">
  
<p>This tool will help you create web-based <em>problem-based</em> investigation that uses <em>real-time data</em> to investigate <em>real-world phenomena</em>.  Investigations are delivered online and consist of student-centered learning projects that demonstrate the application of a science concept or theme.  The activities you develop can generally be utilized within a single class period, or as a homework assignment.  Each focuses on a core idea in oceanography and can use real data, including data collected from oceanographic instruments, results from numerical models, or laboratory studies. Investigations can also include animations and conceptual diagrams, providing context to the science concepts or processes that are relevant to students learning about the natural world.</p>
    
<p><strong>How do I get started?</strong></p>
<p>The tool will walk you through steps for preparing, creating, and publishing an online data investigation.  Each tab above represents an important step in developing your activity.  You can go through the tabs in any order.  The order shown in this wizard is the same that students will see when conducting their investigation.  </p>

<p>However, if you are a new user, we suggest you try to create your investigation using the following development order, which follows a <em>backwards design</em> approach used often when developing curricula. Even if you are unfamiliar with how to conduct inquiry-based lessons in your classroom, this tool will walk you through the steps needed to compose an effective activity. </p>

  <p><strong>How can I use this tool?</strong></p>
  <p>With this tool you can create an online inquiry-based activity that enables your students to learn about ocean processes as they investigate datasets from the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) or your own research.</p>
  <p>This tool will walk you through the steps needed to compose an effective activity - which we call a Data Investigation.  By incorporating data visualizations built using the Visualization tools on this site, you can create an activity that allows students to explore real world phenomena.</p>
  <p>Online investigations created with this tool can be utilized in a variety of ways, including as in-class exercises, instructor-led demonstrations or as homework assignments.</p>
  <p>We encourage you to check out the <strong>Featured Investigations</strong> created by your colleagues that you can use right away with your students.  Or, if you prefer, you can also copy an existing investigation and modify it to fit your needs.</p>

  <p><strong>What is the OOI?</strong></p>
  <p>The key goal of the Data Investigation Builder is to help students and instructors utilize the data coming from the Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI) in undergraduate teaching environments.  The OOI is a long-term, NSF funded program to provide 25 years of sustained ocean measurements.  The OOI instrumentation supports research on climate variability, ocean circulation and ecosystem dynamics, air-sea exchange, seafloor processes, and plate-scale geodynamics. The OOI will enable powerful new scientific approaches for exploring the complexities of Earth-ocean-atmosphere interactions, thereby accelerating progress toward the goal of understanding, predicting, and managing our ocean environment.  The OOI provides a unique opportunity to engage students in productive research using this state-of-the-art oceanographic platform, and the Data Investigation Builder aims to support the usage of its data in learning environments.</p>
