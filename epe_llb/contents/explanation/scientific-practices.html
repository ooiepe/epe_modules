<p><strong>Scientific Practices in Practice</strong></p>

<p>On the Challenge page, you were asked to select a relevant scientific practice that you would like students to practice as part of this exercise.  The instructions and questions you provide on this page should guide students towards answering the challenge question using the practice you selected.  Essentially, you are guiding them to complete the task using a specific assessment mechanism.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you asked students to <em>develop a conceptual model</em>, you might have them use the Concept Mapping tool to document their model.</li>
  <li>If you asked them to <em>analyze or interpret data</em>, you should ask them identify and/or describe a phenomena or event in the data.  This might take the form of a written report.</li>
  <li>If you asked them to <em>construct an explanation</em>, then they might capture some screenshots of the data and write up their explanation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your questions should help students interpret the data and make inferences using the science concepts you wish them to become familiar with.  If you wish students to simply confirm a known process by analyzing observations, they should be able to summarize the dataset and confirm that it matches the process as explained in background section.  If you are hoping students will develop a deeper understanding of a concept, you should ask students to combine several pieces of evidence, encouraging them to develop their own conclusions based on the data.</p>
