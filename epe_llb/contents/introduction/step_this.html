<p><strong>What do I do on this page?</strong></p>
<p>We suggest developing your investigations using a <em>Backwards Design</em> approach, in which you identify your desired outcome first, and then build the bulk of your activity, all before crafting the introduction.  Information about the process or content to be explored should be provided on the Background page.  This page should engage students in the subject they are about to investigate.</p>
