<p><strong>What do I do on this page?</strong></p>
<p>We suggest developing your investigations using a <em>Backwards Design</em> approach, in which you identify your desired outcome first, and then build the bulk of your investigation before crafting the introduction.  Information about the process or content to be explored should be provided on the Background page.  This page should be used to engage students in the topic they are about to investigate.</p>
