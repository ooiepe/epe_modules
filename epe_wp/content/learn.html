<p>This site hosts an integrated suite of software tools that enable scientists and educators to enhance undergraduate education and engage the general public using OOI data. There are four major tools, each of which can be accessed from the navigation bar near the top of each page. At far right, the <em>Help</em> button links to comprehensive information on various components of the site.</p><p>The <em>Visualization</em> tools are designed to allow you to analyze data from the OOI and other sources such as the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). Focused on time series and profiles, the goal of these tools is to balance capability and usefulness in undergraduate classrooms.</p><p>The <em>Concept Map</em> tool allows you to build a map with shapes to represent concepts and lines with arrows to describe the relationships between them. These maps are widely used in education to aid or evaluate contextual understanding. Our concept map builder can also link data visualizations, lessons, and other <em>Resource Database </em>items. It can also be used to explore collections of expert-made vocabularies that describe ocean-observing systems.</p><p>The <em>Lesson Builder</em> tool is designed to assist undergraduate professors in developing and implementing lessons that employ data, which can be used in class or as homework. Using a &ldquo;wizard&rdquo; that promotes effective education practices, lessons can be designed to challenge students to explore real world oceanographic problems. &nbsp;And thanks to the integration of our tools, lessons can include embedded visualizations and concept maps, as well as images and videos from the <em>Resource Database</em>.</p>
