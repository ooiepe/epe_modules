        <Definition>Argo floats are deployed at the sea surface. The floats sink  to a prescribed depth (usually 1,000 meters), collecting data on the descent. They  rest at depth for a prescribed period and rise back to the surface, collecting  data on the rise.  Some floats are  designed to sink to 2,000 meters before ascending to the surface. At the surface, the  floats transmit to satellites positioning and oceanographic  data collected since their last transmission.  The floats then sink again to repeat the cycle that  typically lasts 10 days. Over the course of an average lifetime, an Argo float  completes about 150 cycles. Temperature, salinity and depth are measured, but new sensor technologies will allow additional sensors to be mounted on each float, such as dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll indicators, and optical plankton counters.  [This is directly from the Argo site -- need to boil down to succint type or make specific argo-subsurface-float??]</Definition>

        <Definition>A Towed Underwater Vehicle (TUV) are stable platforms or sleds towed behind a moving ship.  Some are designed to move up and down to provide sampling throughout the water column, while others remain a fixed depths for hydroacoustic surveys.  TUVs also provide isolation of sensors away from noise of the ship. TUVs routinely are used in rapid response applications in coastal monitoring programs and have broad utility because they can be configured easily with a wide array of multiple sensors.</Definition>

        <Definition>A Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) are unoccupied, highly maneuverable platform and operated by a person aboard a host vessel, linked by a tether.  The tether can be lengthened or shortened to manage drag in strong currents.  The tether also holds the cables that provide electrical power, video and data signals back and forth between the operator and the ROV.  In commercial high power applications, electrical power drive motors which in turn drive a hydraulic pump used for torque tools and manipulator arms.  ROVs are most commonly used in deepwater industries such as offshore oil and coal. Most ROVs are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment may include sonars, magnetometers, a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and instruments that measure water clarity, light penetration and temperature.</Definition>

        <Definition>An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air, or, in general, the atmosphere of a planet. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers.</Definition>

        <Definition>A benthic lander (aka seabed lander) or bottom mount (aka bottom frame) is a type of frame used to carry one or more instruments to the seabed where it remains until it is recovered.  Different payloads are used to measure a host of different variables. Cameras, acoustic doppler current profilers (ADCPs), and temperature and salinity measurements being the most common but many types of instruments can be mounted.</Definition>

        <Definition>A weather or sounding balloon is a balloon (specifically a type of high altitude balloon) which carries instruments aloft to send back information on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and wind speed by means of a small, expendable measuring device called a radiosonde. To obtain wind data, they can be tracked by radar, radio direction finding, or navigation systems (such as the satellite-based Global Positioning System, GPS). Balloons meant to stay at a constant altitude for long periods of time are known as transosondes.</Definition>

        <Definition>Automated Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are self-propelled autonomous vehicles that can carry larger payload than a glider because they are externally powered.  However, power limits often limit endurance to 1-2 days.  AUVs can facilitate the detection and enumeration of fish and zooplankton in boundary areas, and measure the physical and biological characteristics of their habitats or map geological features at locations that are hard to survey by ship.</Definition>

        <Definition>A buoy that is anchored at fixed location and regularly collect observations from many different atmospheric and oceanographic sensors. Moored buoys are usually deployed to serve national forecasting needs, maritime  safety needs or to observe regional climate patterns. Measurements from the buoy include surface variables (wind, air and sea surface temperature, salinity, air pressure), as well as subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 500 plus meters.</Definition>

        <Definition>A buoy developed to specifically measure dynamics of the ocean surface.  While it is a moored buoy, it uses accelerometers and a magnetic compass to sense the motion of the buoy at a given location. These types of buoys measure the frequency, and size of the wave energy that help determine the significant wave height, peak wave period, and directions from which these values are the highest.   Other sensors such as water temperature</Definition>

        <Definition>An autonomous vehicle that moves vertically by controlling buoyancy but with wings it gains forward horizontal propulsion and has a rudder for steering.  Gliders move slowly (~20km/day) and are not as maneuverable as a propelled vehicle.  Gliders can cross large horizontal areas while vertically undulating the water column or can undulate at a near-fixed position acting as a virtual mooring.  Programmed to follow a set of mission parameters gliders can navigate autonomously and can be reprogrammed to meet the needs of any given mission.  Detailed data are stored locally on the glider, while a subset of flight and sensor data are transmitted when the glider surfaces via two-way (radio modems, cell phone or satellite) communication.  Typical payload sensors measure salinity, water temperature, and water quality parameters.</Definition>

        <Definition>Drifting buoys are free drifting platforms with a float or buoys that keep the drifter at the surface and underwater sails or sock that catch the current. They have sensors to make meteorological and oceanographic measurements, such as air pressure and water temperature, and by tracking their positions the surface currents can be determined. Some drifters also have sensors to measure wind and salinity.</Definition>

        <Definition>A specially designed station that is located on the shoreline and that is precisely surveyed to know the station's gauge placement relative to standard vertical datum. This provides measured tidal heights to a high degree of accuracy.  A protective acoustic sounding tube and the tidal staff with a pressure sensor are mounted to a leg or pylon of a pier or stationary (non-floationg) dock that has been surveyed.  The stations are designed to continue operating in extreme storms and to be highly reliable. In addition to measuring tidal heights these stations can record many different oceanographic and meteorological parameters. Some include wind speed and direction, water current speed and direction, air and water temperature, and barometric pressure. In coastal areas, river level stations can double as tide guage stations or vice versa.</Definition>
