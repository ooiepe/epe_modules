      <p>Now that you have identified the science concepts and datasets you wish to use, we are ready to begin assembling your activity. </p>
      <p>The first step is to identify the research challenge you wish your students to pursue.  This may or may not be the scientific problem or research question you would like your students to investigate, depending on whether you would like them to identify a research question or relationship themselves.</p>
        <p>We suggest using one of the following approaches, which are based on typical science practices.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop a conceptual model to explain ...</li>
          <li>Analyze data from ... to identify/explain ...</li>
          <li>Construct an explanation using the data provided that describes ... .</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The challenge you give to your students should connect your science concept goals with applied skills you hope them to develop.</p>
