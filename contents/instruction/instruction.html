<p>This tool will help you create an online homework assignment, lecture demonstration, or laboratory using archived or real time data from the Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI).  </p>
<p><em>The OOI is a long-term, NSF funded program to provide 25-30 years of sustained ocean measurements to study climate variability, ocean circulation and ecosystem dynamics, air-sea exchange, seafloor processes, and plate-scale geodynamics.  The OOI will enable powerful new scientific approaches for exploring the complexities of Earth-ocean-atmosphere interactions, thereby accelerating progress toward the goal of understanding, predicting, and managing our ocean environment.</em> </p>
<p>Use this tool to help your undergraduate students learn how interpret scientific data and draw conclusions.   We have made this software ?smart? in attempts to help you apply the latest and best information from the learning sciences to help you improve your students? ability to learn science content.  The activities created with this tool are ideal for introductory undergraduate classes or as engagement activities for senior level classes. </p>

<p>The tool will walk you through three steps for preparing, creating, and publishing an online lesson.</p>
<p>Student in undergraduate introductory science courses often complain that their courses lacked student?teacher dialogue, are overly focused on memorization, and lacked illustrations, applications, and implications of the material covered.  To avoid these pitfalls, this tool will help you prepare:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>the question you want your students to investigate</strong>, to help generate student interest/need to know,</li>
  <li><strong>a review of the prior knowledge necessary to complete the lesson</strong>, to establish relevance and connections, and </li>
  <li><strong>an outline of the procedures students will use to answer the science question/investigation</strong>, that will help them understand the process and nature of science and/or build science skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>Create your own ocean science investigation</p>
<p>With this tool you can create an online inquiry-based activity, enabling your students to learn about ocean processes as they investigate datasets from the OOI or your own research.</p>
<p>Even if you are unfamiliar with how to conduct inquiry-based learning in your classroom, this tool will walk you through the steps needed to compose an effective activity. You will even be able to choose the appropriate inquiry level you desire. You can use the activities you create as either in-class or homework assignments, or both.</p>
<p>If you haven?t already, we also encourage you to check out the ?Featured Investigations? created by others. You can use those activities right away with your students, and you can even copy and modify them to fit your needs.</p>
