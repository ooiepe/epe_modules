          <p>In this activity, students will learn...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>... how changes in in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions affect ocean pH and how those changes impact calcifying organisms in the ocean.  Carbon is the backbone to life on earth and it plays an important role in our atmosphere as well as our oceans.</li>
            <li>... the relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen.  Understanding the properties of water is critical for understanding oceanic ecosystems.</li>
            <li>... how temperature and salinity vary over the course of a year at several locations.  Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of these parameters will help students identify different habitat zones.</li>
