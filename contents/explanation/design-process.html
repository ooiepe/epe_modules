<p>After student have reviewed all of the datasets, they will be able to summarize and synthesize the information presented.  We suggest adding questions that lead to one of the following outcomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a (conceptual) model - Students can use the EPE Concept Mapping tool to document their model</li>
        <li>Analyze interpret data - For example, recognize and describe a phenomena seen in the data</li>
        <li>Construct an expiation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These questions should be designed to help students interpret the data and make inferences to the science concepts you wish them to become familiar with.</p>
      <p>If you wish students to simply confirm an observed process, students should be able to summarize the dataset and confirm that it matches the expectations set out in the problem and background sections.</p>
      <p>If you are hoping for a deeper understanding, you should ask students to combine several pieces of evidence to develop their own conclusions based on the data. </p>
