<p>In this step we will walk through how to create a lesson that takes into account your students? prior knowledge. Understanding your students? ideas about the science will allow you to help them make sense of new information, and establish relevance and connections in their existing knowledge.</p>

<p>The view in contemporary learning theory is that people construct new knowledge and understanding based on what they already know and believe. New knowledge must be constructed from existing knowledge causing us as educator to need to pay attention to incomplete and/or naive understandings of their students (Bransford et al 2000). Think about potential pitfalls your students might/have had in the past learning this concept. With that in mind create and/or identify helpful background information that will help your students explore the science question and dataset you have already identified.</p>
