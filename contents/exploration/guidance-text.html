      <p>Here are some tips on how to use the different resource types as datasets in your activity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visualization Tools</strong> - Create your own customized EPE visualization tools to focus students' attention on particular datasets, processes or analyses.  If you wish to <strong>scaffold</strong> your students' use of the tools, you can create multiple tools that increase in complexity.  For example, students might start off with one tool with a single station, and then use another tool that has additional stations or variables.</li>
        <li><strong>Images</strong> - Use this resource type if you would like students to use a static image.  This might be a map, graph, chart, photograph, diagram, or a slide exported from your presentation.  You can select an image already in the EPE database or upload your own.</li>
        <li><strong>Videos</strong> - Videos can also be used as "data" especially if the clip you wish to use is from an underwater camera.  Of course, you might also consider using videos that provide additional background on the topics students are investigating.</li>
        <li><strong>Concept Map</strong> - Consider creating a concept map if you would like students to explore a more complex topic or non-linear process.</li>
      </ul>
