<p>The heart of your investigation is the <strong>Exploration</strong> step, in which students view each of the datasets you have selected and consider the questions you have proposed.</p>
<p>First, identify the datasets or evidence you would like students to investigate during this activity.</p>
<p>Then, for each dataset, add a description and one or more investigation questions.</p>
<p>These datasets will be the evidence students will use to answer the research challenge question while conduct their investigation using data provided.  The objective is to help students understand the process and nature of science by building their science skills in analyzing and interpreting data, constructing explanations and building models.</p>
<p>To help guide students as they investigate the datasets, you should provide some additional instructions or questions to help focus their research on the research challenge.  This text will appear at the top of the list of datasets in the Exploration section.</p>
