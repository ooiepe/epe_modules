<p><strong>Dataset Tips</strong>
<p>You can use several different kinds of datasets in your investigation.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Visualizations:</strong> Create your own customized visualizations to focus students' attention on particular datasets, processes or analyses. You can create multiple tools that increase in complexity in order to <em>scaffold</em> your students' use of the tools. For example, start off with a visualization of a single time-series and then create a second visualization that has additional stations or variables for students to compare.</li>
  <li><strong>Concept Maps:</strong> Consider creating a concept map if you would like students to explore a complex topic or if you would like to create a diagram that allows them to explore a non-linear process.</li>
  <li><strong>Images:</strong> Use this resource type if you would like students to analyze a static image. This might be a map, graph, chart, photograph, diagram, or a slide exported from a presentation. You can select images already included in the resource database or upload your own.</li>
  <li><strong>Videos:</strong> Even videos can be considered &quot;data.&quot;  This is especially true of video from underwater cameras. Of course, you can also consider using videos that provide background information on the topics students are investigating.</li>
  <li><strong>Document Files:</strong> If you have a scientific paper, a worksheet, or an Excel file you would like students to investigate, you can add that too.</li>
</ul>
