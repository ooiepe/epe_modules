<p><strong>Example Learning Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Each of the examples below includes both a specific learning objective as well as a statement that emphasizes the importance or relevance of what will be studied in the investigation to the real world.</p>

<p>In this investigation, students will...</p>
<ul>
<li>...learn how changes in in CO2 emissions affect ocean pH and how those changes impact calcifying organisms in the ocean. Carbon is the backbone to life on earth and it plays an important role in our atmosphere as well as our oceans.</li>
<li>...analyze the relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen. Understanding the properties of water is critical for understanding oceanic ecosystems.</li>
<li>...compare how temperature and salinity vary over the course of a year at several locations. Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of these parameters will help students identify the physical characteristics that differentiate different habitat zones.</li>
</ul>
